So you start a blog and then you can't decide what to write about in your first post. So I decided to write why I want to be a data scientist and any cool things I've seen.

So I first discovered data science accidently while perusing courses on Udemy when I was looking for courses to improve my SQL skills.
The course was only a tenner so I thought why not since it had the word **'data'** involved. I started the course and realised this encompasses almost everything I want in a role whilst not wasting my years of experience an analyst. It involves analysis, programming, statistics and sharing insights with clients/shareholders. 

Whilst taking the course I realised there was a lot more statistics involved than I had in my wheelhouse. I hated statistics at school and university just because I wasn't good at it. Every over aspect I excelled at but statistics was always my weakness so I avoided as much as I could(paying for it now aren't I)




There's no point doing all this if you can't action any of the insight you've found
