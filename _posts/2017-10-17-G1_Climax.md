Here's a post that is slightly different to the other posts that I've done so far. Rather than having a step by step tutorial
on how to do something. The below allows me to work on my python skills and explain a few things as I go along.

People who work in Data Science tend to work in programming languages R or Python. I've been learning both languages over the last two years and at the moment I'm trying to get better at my Python. One of things people say is to get better at data science is to work on data that you have an interest in. 

One of my main passions in life has been wrestling (which my wife says is lame).  I've watched wrestling for the last 19 years which when you write down is actually quite scary. In this case, I decided do some analysis on Japanese Wrestling! In particular, the G1 Climax tournament.

The G1 Climax is an annual Japanese wrestling tournament that's held every summer over 20 days. Rather than a simple knockout tournament it's a league made up of two blocks (named A block & B block) each consisting of 20 wrestlers. The winner of each block then face off and the winner goes to headline wrestle kingdom in January.



Let's start off with importing all the relevant libraries which will be updated as we go


```python
import pandas as pd #standard package to work with dataframes
import numpy as np
import itertools # We use this to do some permutations to work out potential matches
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import math
import decimal
import datetime
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
sns.set_style('white')
```
