Here's a post that is slightly different to the other posts that I've done so far. Rather than having a step by step tutorial
on how to do something. The below allows me to work on my python skills and explain a few things as I go along.

People who work in Data Science tend to work in programming languages R or Python. I've been learning both languages over the last two years and at the moment I'm trying to get better at my Python. One of things people say is to get better at data science is to work on data that you have an interest in. 

One of my main passions in life has been wrestling (which my wife says is lame).  I've watched wrestling for the last 19 years which when you write down is actually quite scary. In this case, I decided do some analysis on Japanese Wrestling! In particular, the G1 Climax tournament.

The G1 Climax is an annual Japanese wrestling tournament that's held every summer over 20 days. Rather than a simple knockout tournament it's a league made up of two blocks (named A block & B block) each consisting of 20 wrestlers. The winner of each block then face off and the winner goes to headline wrestle kingdom in January.



Let's start off with importing all the relevant libraries which will be updated as we go


```python
import pandas as pd #standard package to work with dataframes
import numpy as np
import itertools # We use this to do some permutations to work out potential matches
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import math
import decimal
import datetime
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
sns.set_style('white')
```

Here are some potential things to look at:
*Who on average has highest match rating?
Does Dave Meltzer's rating correlate with match time or any other variables?*

Let's start off by reading the csv file I quickly made up with the wrestler's names and which block they're in.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("G1 Competitors.csv") #Using pandas read_csv
```

We use the data frame property .info() to give us some quick info on the data frame

```python
df.info() #use the dataframe propetry .info() to give us information on the dataframe
```
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    RangeIndex: 10 entries, 0 to 9
    Data columns (total 2 columns):
    A Block    10 non-null object
    B Block    10 non-null object
    dtypes: object(2)
    memory usage: 240.0+ bytes

The information above tells us that the data frame only contains 10 entries with no null objects which is good to see. We can just type in **df** into the console and see what the whole data frame looks like. Of course if we had more rows we wouldn't be able to do this and would use *df.head()*

```python
df
```


| | A Block | B Block |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Hiroshi Tanahashi | Kazuchika Okada |
| 1 | Togi Makabe | Toru Yano |
| 2 | Tomohiro Ishii | Satoshi Kojima |
| 3 | Hirooki Goto | Michael Elgin |
| 4 | YOSHI-HASHI | Juice Robinson |
| 5 | Bad Luck Fale | Tama Tonga |
| 6 | Yuji Nagata | SANADA |
| 7 | Zack Sabre Jr. | EVIL |
| 8 | Kota Ibushi | Minoru Suzuki |
| 9 | Tetsuya Naito | Kenny Omega |

I noticed that some of the wrestler's name have capitals while others don't. Let's convert all the names to upper case.
We use the data frame method applymap which applies a function to every cell in a data frame and rather than writing a whole function we will just create one inside in the applymap also known as an anonymous function.

```python
df = df.applymap(lambda x: x.upper()) 
df # Let's print the dataframe to see if that's worked
```

| | A Block | B Block |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | HIROSHI TANAHASHI | KAZUCHIKA OKADA |
| 1 | TOGI MAKABE | TORU YANO |
| 2 | TOMOHIRO ISHII | SATOSHI KOJIMA |
| 3 | HIROOKI GOTO | MICHAEL ELGIN |
| 4 | YOSHI-HASHI | JUICE ROBINSON |
| 5 | BAD LUCK FALE | TAMA TONGA |
| 6 | YUJI NAGATA | SANADA |
| 7 | ZACK SABRE JR. | EVIL |
| 8 | KOTA IBUSHI | MINORU SUZUKI |
| 9 | TETSUYA NAITO | KENNY OMEGA |

Let's now separate the wrestler from data frames **df** in two data frames called **A_Block** and **B_Block**


```python
A_Block = pd.DataFrame(df['A Block'])
A_Block.columns = ['Wrestler']
B_Block = pd.DataFrame(df['B Block'])
B_Block.columns = ['Wrestler']
```

Ok we've now got two separate data frames called *A_Block* & *B_Block*. Let's add the usual fields you'd see in any sports league **'Matches','Wins','Losses','Draws'**. 

I'm also going to include **'Match Time'** as the total time a wrestler has competed. I also plan to add another column called **'DMR'**, which stands for Dave Meltzer Rating. Dave Meltzer is a 30 year wrestling journalist whose ratings of matches are out of five and is held in high standing in the wrestling community. By default, I've set these to NaN


```python
A_Block['Matches'] = np.NAN
A_Block['Wins'] = np.NAN
A_Block['Losses'] = np.NAN
A_Block['Draws'] = np.NAN
A_Block['Points'] = np.NAN
A_Block['Match_Time'] = np.NAN
A_Block['DMR'] = 0.00
B_Block['Matches'] = np.NAN
B_Block['Wins'] = np.NAN
B_Block['Losses'] = np.NAN
B_Block['Draws'] = np.NAN
B_Block['Points'] = np.NAN
B_Block['Match_Time'] = np.NAN
B_Block['DMR'] = 0.00
```
