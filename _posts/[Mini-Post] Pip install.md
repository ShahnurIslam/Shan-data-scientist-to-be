Basically I thought it would be useful to mention this as I found it a bit difficult to find a step by step guide on how to install python
libraries if you don't have an understanding of command line functions.

You need to download the relevant package that matches your version of Python(2 or 3) and OS(operating system) from the site below 

https://pypi.python.org/pypi


You also need the full directory of pip where it was intalled
"C:/Users/shahnur islam/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36/Scripts/pip"
