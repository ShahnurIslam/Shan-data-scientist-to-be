Basically I thought it would be useful to mention this as I found it a bit difficult to find a step by step guide on how to install python
libraries if you don't have a huge understanding of command line functions.

The basic idea is to run the program 'pip' from the command line to and tell it to install the python library you desire.

Let's run through an example, I use a windows machine so that's the example I'm going to use. 

**Step 1 **
Download the relevant package that matches your version of Python(2 or 3) and OS(operating system) from the site below 

https://pypi.python.org/pypi

I'm going to download the numpy package for Python 3.6 and windows 64



You also need the full directory of pip where it was intalled
