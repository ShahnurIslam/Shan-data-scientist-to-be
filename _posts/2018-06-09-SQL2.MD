I said I'd continue these posts this year and that's what I plan to do! A sequel to my post on SQL! *(My wife thought this was a terrible joke)*

Now let's talk about SEGMENTATION! 

Segmentation isn't something I found as intuitive as basic SQL. You can generally figure out what a basic SQL statement is going to do before it runs. Have a look at my last  [SQL post](http://shan-data-science.co.uk/2017-05-15-sql1/) for an example.

The general idea of segmentation is exactly as it sounds. You're slicing the data into segments or groups*(I've also seen this referred to as stratifying)*.

Segmenting can also lead to clustering but that involves using algorithms such as Hierarchical or K-means that I won't cover that here*(Maybe in future posts!)*


But here are a few real world examples of segmentation:

- Grouping Customers into segments based on their sales data. You could potentially have 3 groups such as *low spenders, medium spenders, high spenders*
- Grouping data by address e.g. City. Looking at most profitable cities
- Grouping into desirable records and undesirable records.

I'll be using the third example to to quickly demonstrate

I've created a dummy table of records that shows a list of 500 advertising campaigns*(I work in advertising)* with their spends, income generated and ROI. You can find the data here.
I'm going to group the data into successful(desirable) and unsucessful(undesirable) campaigns.
Here I'm going to define a successful campaign as a ROI > 0.8


Segementation Query:

```
SELECT Result, COUNT(*) FROM
(SELECT
CASE  WHEN ROI > 0.8  THEN 'Successful' 
ELSE 'Unsucessful' END AS Result FROM Campaigns) t1
GROUP BY Result

```

Which gives us the below:

With a couple of lines of SQL we have sucessfully segmented our data into some useful information.

Let's break it down a bit so we understand how it works. The key statement for segmentation starts within the brackets.

This statement creates a conditional column in our Campaigns table using the SQL function **CASE**. If we just run this statement by itself. We get the below.





For every row in the table it check if the ROI is greater than 0.8. If this is True, it returns the value "Success" for that row and "Unsuccessful" when it is less than 0.8.


The rest of the Syntax allows us to group it together.

Hopefully this gave you a basic idea of segmentation and how useful it can be!

Thanks for reading- Till the next post!
