subtitle: Why I started this blog
---

Hi my name is Shahnur(Shan for short). I'm currently a  data analyst based in London for a Marketing Agency. I have a background in Maths and did some programming in school. 

I discovered data science about a year ago and realised it was my perfect job. So I talked it over with my wife(who I think is the only person to still play Pokemon GO) and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.

At the moment here are things I would like to finish in 2017
- Udemy course Workshop in Probability & Statics**(48% done)**. My statistics wasn't great so decided to brush up as this is a key part of data science
- Become proficient in Python & R
- Finish readhing Hadley Wickhams R for Data Sciene book(available online http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
