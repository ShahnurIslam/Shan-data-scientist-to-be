subtitle: Why I started this blog
---

Hi my name is Shan. I'm currently a  data analyst based in London for a Marketing Agency. with a background in mathematics and some programming I did in school. 

I discovered data science about a year ago and realised it was my dream job. So I talked it over with my wife and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.

At the moment here are things I would like to finish in 2017
- Udemy course Workshop in Probability & Statics**(50% done)**. My statistics wasn't great so decided to brush up as this is a key part of data science
- Become proficient in Python & R
- Finish reading Hadley Wickhams R for Data Sciene book [available online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
