subtitle: Why I started this blog
---

Hi my name is Shan. I'm currently a  data analyst based in London for a Marketing Agency, with a background in mathematics and some programming I did in school. 

I discovered data science about 2 years ago and realised it was my dream job. So I talked it over with my wife and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.

## Update 2018

I didn't post or accomplish as many tasks as I would have liked in 2017 but hopefully I can change that this year.

At the moment here are things I would like to finish in 2018
- Post at least 10 times this year
- Finish the Data Science specilisation on Coursera. Currently I've done ~~3~~ 4 out of 9 modules to date.
- Udemy course Workshop in Probability & Statics **(68% done)**. My statistics wasn't great so decided to brush up as this is a key part of data science
- Become proficient in Python & R
- Finish reading Hadley Wickhams R for Data Science book [available online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
